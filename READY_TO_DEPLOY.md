2. Get testnet SUI:
   sui client faucet

3. Build contracts:
   cd suilfg_launch
   sui move build

4. Deploy to testnet:
   sui client publish --gas-budget 500000000

5. Save all object IDs:
   - Package ID
   - PlatformConfig ID
   - AdminCap ID
   - TickerRegistry ID

6. Update deployments/testnet.json with IDs

7. Test token creation flow

See DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md for complete instructions! ✅

================================================================================
CRITICAL PATHS:
==============

Can't launch without:
1. Smart contracts deployed ← START HERE
2. Compilation API (users can't create tokens)
3. Basic frontend (users can't access platform)
4. Indexer (price/data updates)

Can launch without (add later):
1. Graduation bot (manual graduation works)
2. Wallet integrations (users check your site)
3. Moon Race (nice to have)
4. Referrals (can add post-launch)
5. Cetus integration (manual pool creation works)

MVP = Contracts + Compilation API + Basic Frontend + Indexer
Timeline: 3-4 weeks
