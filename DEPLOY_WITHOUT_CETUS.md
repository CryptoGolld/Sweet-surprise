# ðŸš€ DEPLOY NOW - Manual Pool Creation (Works Immediately!)

## Problem:
Cetus repo requires GitHub authentication or may not be public.

## Solution:
Deploy WITHOUT Cetus integration for now. You can:
1. âœ… Test everything except automatic pool creation
2. âœ… Create Cetus pools manually when tokens graduate
3. âœ… Add Cetus integration later via contract upgrade

---

## What Works NOW:

```
âœ… All bonding curve functionality
âœ… Buy/sell tokens
âœ… Fees (3% total)
âœ… Graduation trigger
âœ… Fee distribution
âœ… Team allocation (2M tokens)
âœ… Ticker economy
âœ… seed_pool_prepare() - gives you LP assets
```

## What You Do Manually:

```
When a token graduates:
1. Call try_graduate()
2. Call distribute_payouts()  
3. Call seed_pool_prepare()
4. Manually create Cetus pool with the assets
5. Manually lock for 100 years (optional)
```

---

## Deploy Commands:

```bash
cd suilfg_launch
sui move build        # Should work now!
sui client publish --gas-budget 500000000
```

---

## After Graduation (Manual Process):

**Step 1-3: Automatic (via bot or manual)**
```bash
# 1. Graduate
sui client call --function try_graduate ...

# 2. Distribute fees
sui client call --function distribute_payouts ...

# 3. Prepare LP assets
sui client call --function seed_pool_prepare ...
# This sends 207M tokens + 12k SUI to lp_recipient
```

**Step 4: Manual Cetus Pool Creation**
```bash
# Use Cetus UI or SDK to:
# 1. Create pool with the assets you received
# 2. Add liquidity
# 3. Optionally lock LP
```

---

## Later: Add Cetus Integration

When you find the correct Cetus dependency:

1. Uncomment Cetus in Move.toml
2. Uncomment Cetus code in bonding_curve.move
3. Rebuild and upgrade contract
4. Now automatic!

---

## This Is Fine For Launch!

Many platforms launch with manual pool creation first.
Benefits:
- âœ… Launch faster (TODAY!)
- âœ… Test everything
- âœ… Build frontend
- âœ… Get users
- âœ… Add automation later

Manual pool creation takes ~2 minutes per token.
If you have 1 graduation per day, that's fine!
