# Cetus Burn Manager - How It Actually Works

## 🔥 The Magic of Cetus Burn Manager

### What I Misunderstood ❌

I initially thought:
- Burning LP = Destroy position completely
- Can't claim fees after burning

### What It Actually Does ✅

**Cetus Burn Manager:**
- 🔥 **Burns the LP position** (makes it non-transferable, locked forever)
- 🔒 **Liquidity permanently locked** (cannot withdraw)
- ✅ **Fees still claimable!** (can collect trading fees anytime)
- 🎯 **Best of both worlds!**

---

## 💰 How It Works

### Standard LP Position (Without Burn Manager)

```
LP Position NFT
├─ Can withdraw liquidity ✅
├─ Can transfer position ✅
├─ Can claim fees ✅
└─ Risk: Owner can rug pull ⚠️
```

### After Cetus Burn Manager

```
Burned LP Position
├─ Can withdraw liquidity ❌ (LOCKED FOREVER)
├─ Can transfer position ❌ (NON-TRANSFERABLE)
├─ Can claim fees ✅ (FEES STILL WORK!)
└─ Risk: Zero rug pull risk ✅
```

## 🎯 Your Pool Setup

### Fee Tier: **1%** (100 basis points)

**Configuration:**
```bash
TICK_SPACING=200  # 1% fee tier
```

**Cetus Fee Tiers:**
| Fee % | Tick Spacing | Use Case |
|-------|--------------|----------|
| 0.01% | 1 | Stablecoins |
| 0.05% | 10 | Blue chips |
| 0.25% | 60 | Standard tokens |
| 0.30% | 100 | Standard tokens |
| **1.00%** | **200** | **Memecoins** ⭐ |

**Why 1%?**
- ✅ Higher revenue per trade
- ✅ Standard for volatile/memecoin pairs
- ✅ Still competitive vs DEX aggregators
- ✅ Better for lower liquidity pools

## 💸 Fee Revenue (1% vs 0.25%)

### Example Pool: 10K SUI Daily Volume

**With 0.25% fees:**
```
Daily = 10,000 × 0.0025 = 25 SUI
Monthly = 750 SUI
Annual = 9,125 SUI
```

**With 1% fees:**
```
Daily = 10,000 × 0.01 = 100 SUI
Monthly = 3,000 SUI
Annual = 36,500 SUI
```

**4x more revenue!** 🚀

### Revenue Comparison Table

| Daily Volume | 0.25% Fees | 1% Fees | Difference |
|--------------|------------|---------|------------|
| 5K SUI | 12.5 SUI | 50 SUI | **4x more** |
| 10K SUI | 25 SUI | 100 SUI | **4x more** |
| 50K SUI | 125 SUI | 500 SUI | **4x more** |
| 100K SUI | 250 SUI | 1,000 SUI | **4x more** |

## 🤖 Bot Process (Corrected)

### Step 1: Graduate & Extract Liquidity
```javascript
prepare_liquidity_for_bot()
→ Receives: 12K SUI + 207M tokens
```

### Step 2: Create Cetus Pool
```javascript
createPoolTransactionPayload({
  tickSpacing: 200,  // 1% fee tier ✅
  ...
})
```

### Step 3: Add Full-Range Liquidity
```javascript
openPositionTransactionPayload({
  tickLower: -443636,
  tickUpper: 443636,
})
```

### Step 4: Burn LP with Cetus Burn Manager
```javascript
burnManager.createBurnTransaction({
  positionId,
  recipient: botAddress,  // Who can claim fees
})
```

**Result:**
- ✅ Liquidity locked forever (anti-rug)
- ✅ Position non-transferable
- ✅ Fees claimable by bot address
- ✅ 1% of all trading volume!

---

## 💰 Fee Collection

### Using Fee Collector Script

```javascript
// fee-collector.js (included)

// Check for claimable fees
const fees = await cetusSDK.Position.getPositionFees(positionId);

// Claim fees (even though position is burned!)
const collectTx = await cetusSDK.Position.collectFeeTransactionPayload({
  positionId,
});

// Transfer to treasury
tx.transferObjects([fees], platformTreasury);
```

**How often:**
- Daily collection (automated)
- Or manually when needed
- Fees accumulate continuously

---

## 🔒 Security Guarantees

### What's Locked:
- ✅ **Principal liquidity** (12K SUI + 207M tokens)
- ✅ **LP position** (cannot be withdrawn)
- ✅ **Transfer ability** (cannot sell position)

### What's NOT Locked:
- ✅ **Trading fees** (accumulate and claimable)
- ✅ **Fee collection** (anytime by recipient)

### Who Can Claim Fees:
- The `recipient` address in burn transaction
- In our case: Bot address (or platform treasury)
- Fees sent to `PLATFORM_TREASURY` automatically

---

## 📊 Real-World Example

### Pool Launch Day:
```
Pool created: 12K SUI + 207M tokens
Fee tier: 1%
LP Status: Burned (locked forever)
```

### Week 1:
```
Daily volume: 20K SUI
Daily fees: 200 SUI (1% of 20K)
Weekly fees: 1,400 SUI
Status: Fees accumulate in burned position ✅
```

### Week 2:
```
Fee collector runs:
- Detects 1,400 SUI + tokens in fees
- Claims from burned position ✅
- Transfers to treasury ✅
- Pool liquidity still locked ✅
```

### Ongoing:
```
Every day: Trading fees accumulate (1% of volume)
Daily: Bot collects fees → treasury
Forever: Liquidity stays locked
```
