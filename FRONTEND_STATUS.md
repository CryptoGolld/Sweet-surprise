# ðŸš§ Frontend Development Status

## Issue Encountered

Versioning conflicts between `@mysten/sui` and `@mysten/dapp-kit` packages preventing build.

**Problem**: Multiple conflicting versions of Sui packages causing TypeScript compilation errors.

## Quick Solution Options

### Option A: Use Sui Wallet Adapter (Recommended for quick launch)
- More stable, fewer version conflicts
- Simpler integration
- ETA: 30-45 minutes to working deploy

### Option B: Debug current dapp-kit setup
- More modern but unstable on current versions  
- Could take 1-2 hours to resolve

### Option C: Launch without wallet integration first
- Show coin list and info only
- Add wallet integration post-launch
- ETA: 15 minutes to deploy

## Recommendation

**Go with Option C** for fastest launch:
1. Deploy static frontend showing platform info
2. Add wallet integration after launch
3. Platform backend is 100% ready

This gets us live in <1 hour, we add interactive features incrementally.

**Your call - which option?**
