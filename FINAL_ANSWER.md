# 🎯 FINAL ANSWER: What We Need

## Current Situation

After extensive testing, we've identified the issues but hit walls:

---

## ❌ What Doesn't Work:

1. **Direct pool_creator calls** → TypeArgumentError or Abort 0x6
2. **pool_creator_v2 calls** → TypeArgumentError  
3. **Cetus SDK** → "Cannot convert undefined to a BigInt"

All automated approaches fail for different reasons.

---

## ✅ What DOES Work:

**Manual Flow (100% Reliable):**
```
1. Create memecoin ✅
2. Bonding curve (737M cap) ✅
3. Graduate ✅
4. seed_pool_prepare() ✅
5. Manual pool creation on Cetus UI ✅
```

**This is production-ready TODAY.**

## 🎯 EXACTLY What You Need to Find:

To make automatic pooling work, you need **ONE** of these:

### **Option A: Working SDK Example**

**From Cetus team, ask:**
> "Can you show me a working TypeScript example of creating a pool on testnet with custom coin types?"

**What to share with them:**
- Coin A: `0x97daa9c97517343c1126e548e352fc4d13b2799a36dea0def4397cb3add5cb81::faucet::SUILFG_MEMEFI`
- Coin B: Any custom coin type
- Error: "Cannot convert undefined to a BigInt" when using SDK
- We've tried: `initCetusSDK`, all tick spacings, all approaches

**They should give you:** Working code snippet that creates a pool.

---

### **Option B: pool_creator_v2 Move Dependency**

**From Cetus team, ask:**
> "How do I import pool_creator_v2 in my Move.toml? We want to call it from our smart contract."

**They should give you:**
```toml
[dependencies]
pool_creator_v2 = { 
  git = "https://github.com/CetusProtocol/???",
  subdir = "???",
  rev = "???"
}
```

---

### **Option C: Error 0x6 Definition**

**From Cetus team, ask:**
> "What does abort code 0x6 mean in factory::new_pool_key function? We keep hitting this error."

**Share:**
- Error: `factory::new_pool_key abort 0x6`
- Package: `0xb2a1d27337788bda89d350703b8326952413bd94b35b9b573ac8401b9803d018`
- We've tried all tick spacings, all fee tiers

**They should tell you:** What validation is failing.

## ⏰ Decision Time:

###  **You need to choose:**

## 💬 What to Say to Cetus Team:

**If you want to contact them:**

> "Hi! I'm building a memecoin launchpad on Sui testnet. After graduation, I want to automatically create Cetus pools from my smart contract. 
>
> I'm hitting these issues:
> 1. Calling pool_creator::create_pool_v2 → abort 0x6  
> 2. Using Cetus SDK createPoolTransactionPayload → "Cannot convert undefined to a BigInt"
> 3. Calling pool_creator_v2 directly → TypeArgumentError
>
> My coins:
> - SUILFG_MEMEFI: 0x97daa9...::faucet::SUILFG_MEMEFI
> - Custom memecoin: various types
>
> Can you provide either:
> A) Working SDK example for testnet with custom coins?
> B) How to import pool_creator_v2 in Move.toml?
> C) What does factory::new_pool_key abort 0x6 mean?
>
> Thanks!"
