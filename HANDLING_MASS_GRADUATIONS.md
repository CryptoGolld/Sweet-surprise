# Handling Mass Graduations - How the Bot Scales

## 🚀 Can the Bot Handle 1000 Graduations at Once?

**YES!** ✅ But with smart batching to avoid overwhelming the system.

---

## 📊 How It Works

### Scenario: 1000 Graduations Detected

```
Bot Query: Found 1000 new graduations
├─ Batch 1: Process 10 graduations in parallel
├─ Batch 2: Process 10 graduations in parallel
├─ Batch 3: Process 10 graduations in parallel
├─ ... (98 more batches)
└─ Batch 100: Process 10 graduations in parallel

Total time: ~50-100 minutes
All 1000 pools created successfully! ✅
```

---

## ⚙️ Technical Implementation

### Batch Processing Logic

```javascript
// Configuration
MAX_CONCURRENT_POOLS = 10  // Process 10 at a time

// Found 1000 graduations
newEvents = [event1, event2, ..., event1000]

// Split into batches of 10
for (let i = 0; i < 1000; i += 10) {
  const batch = newEvents.slice(i, i + 10);  // 10 events
  
  logger.info(`Processing batch ${i/10 + 1}: 10 graduations`);
  
  // Process 10 in parallel
  await Promise.all(batch.map(event => 
    handleGraduation(event)
  ));
  
  logger.info(`Batch complete. ${i + 10}/1000 done`);
}
```

### Why Batching?

**Problem without batching:**
```
1000 graduations × 3 transactions each = 3000 transactions
All at once = RPC overload, gas estimation failures, network congestion
```

**Solution with batching:**
```
Batch 1: 10 pools (30 transactions) → Complete
Batch 2: 10 pools (30 transactions) → Complete
...
Batch 100: 10 pools (30 transactions) → Complete

Total: Same 3000 transactions, but spread over time
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ No RPC overload
- ✅ Better gas estimation
- ✅ Error isolation (one failure doesn't break all)
- ✅ Progress tracking
- ✅ Can restart if bot crashes

## ⏱️ Timing Analysis

### Per Pool Creation Time

**Each pool requires 3 transactions:**

1. **prepare_liquidity_for_bot()** (~5-10 seconds)
   - Transaction execution: 3s
   - Wait for indexing: 3s
   - Total: ~6s

2. **Create Cetus pool** (~5-10 seconds)
   - Pool creation: 3s
   - Wait for indexing: 3s
   - Total: ~6s

3. **Add liquidity + Burn LP** (~5-10 seconds)
   - Add liquidity: 2s
   - Burn transaction: 2s
   - Wait for indexing: 3s
   - Total: ~7s

**Per pool total:** ~20 seconds

### Batch Processing Time

**10 pools in parallel:**
```
Pool 1: ████████████████████ (20s)
Pool 2: ████████████████████ (20s)
Pool 3: ████████████████████ (20s)
...
Pool 10: ████████████████████ (20s)

All complete at: ~25 seconds (parallel processing!)
Not 200s (if sequential)
```

**Why not exactly 20s?**
- Network variance: ±3s
- RPC rate limits: May slow down
- Nonce management: Sequential ordering

**Real-world:** ~25-30s per batch of 10

### Total Time for 1000 Graduations

```
1000 graduations ÷ 10 per batch = 100 batches
100 batches × 30 seconds = 3000 seconds
3000 seconds ÷ 60 = 50 minutes

Estimated time: 50-90 minutes for 1000 pools
```

## 🔧 Configurable Batch Size

### Adjust for Your Needs

**Conservative (Safer):**
```bash
MAX_CONCURRENT_POOLS=5  # 5 at a time
# Time for 1000: ~100 minutes
# Pros: Less stress on RPC, more reliable
```

**Balanced (Default):**
```bash
MAX_CONCURRENT_POOLS=10  # 10 at a time
# Time for 1000: ~50 minutes
# Pros: Good balance of speed and reliability
```

**Aggressive (Faster):**
```bash
MAX_CONCURRENT_POOLS=20  # 20 at a time
# Time for 1000: ~25 minutes
# Cons: Might hit RPC rate limits, higher failure rate
```

**Insane (Not Recommended):**
```bash
MAX_CONCURRENT_POOLS=100  # 100 at a time
# Pros: Very fast (~5 minutes)
# Cons: Will likely fail, RPC bans you, nonce conflicts
```

## 🛡️ Error Handling for Mass Graduations

### Individual Failure Handling

```javascript
// One pool fails? Others continue!
batch.map(event => 
  handleGraduation(event).catch(error => {
    logger.error('Pool failed', { event, error });
    // Don't throw - let others complete
  })
);
```

**Example:**
```
Batch 1: Processing 10 graduations
- Pool 1: ✅ Success
- Pool 2: ✅ Success
- Pool 3: ❌ Failed (out of gas)
- Pool 4: ✅ Success
- Pool 5: ✅ Success
- ...
- Pool 10: ✅ Success

Result: 9/10 succeeded, 1 failed (logged)
Bot continues to next batch!
```

### Failed Pool Retry

**Failed pools are logged but NOT automatically retried** to avoid loops.

**Manual intervention:**
```bash
# Check failed pools
grep "Graduation handling failed" logs/combined.log

# Get curve IDs of failed pools
# Manually create pool using Cetus UI or SDK
```

**Or add automatic retry later:**
```javascript
// Store failed graduations
const failedGraduations = [];

// Retry failed ones after processing all new ones
for (const failed of failedGraduations) {
  await handleGraduation(failed);
}
```

## 💰 Gas Management for Mass Graduations

### Gas Consumption

**Per pool creation:**
- prepare_liquidity_for_bot: ~0.05 SUI
- Create pool: ~0.05 SUI
- Add liquidity + Burn: ~0.05 SUI
- **Total: ~0.15 SUI per pool**

**For 1000 pools:**
```
1000 pools × 0.15 SUI = 150 SUI needed
```

### Gas Monitoring

Bot checks gas before each batch:

```javascript
async checkGasBalance() {
  const balance = await this.client.getBalance({
    owner: this.botAddress,
    coinType: '0x2::sui::SUI'
  });
  
  const balanceSUI = Number(balance.totalBalance) / 1e9;
  
  if (balanceSUI < 10) {  // Low gas warning
    logger.warn('⚠️ Low gas balance!', { 
      balance: balanceSUI,
      recommended: 50 
    });
  }
  
  if (balanceSUI < 1) {  // Critical
    logger.error('❌ Insufficient gas! Pausing operations');
    throw new Error('Insufficient gas');
  }
  
  return balanceSUI;
}
```

### Auto Top-Up (Optional Enhancement)

Could add:
```javascript
// If gas < 10 SUI, request from faucet (testnet only)
if (balanceSUI < 10 && CONFIG.network === 'testnet') {
  await requestFaucet(this.botAddress);
}
```

## 📈 Performance Optimization

### Current Architecture

**Single Bot Instance:**
```
1 bot → processes batches sequentially
100 batches × 30s = 50 minutes for 1000 pools
```

### Scale-Up Options (If Needed)

**Option 1: Larger Batches**
```bash
MAX_CONCURRENT_POOLS=20
# Time: ~25 minutes for 1000 pools
# Risk: Higher failure rate
```

**Option 2: Multiple Bot Instances**
```javascript
// Bot A: Processes events 0-499
// Bot B: Processes events 500-999

// Time: ~25 minutes (parallel bots)
// Cons: More complex, need coordination
```

**Option 3: Dedicated Workers**
```javascript
// Main bot: Detects graduations, adds to queue
// Worker bots: Pull from queue, create pools

// Pros: Highly scalable
// Cons: Need Redis/queue system
```

## 🎯 Realistic Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Normal Traffic (1-5 graduations per day)

```
Bot checks every 10s
Finds 1 graduation
Processes in 20-30s
Continues monitoring

Impact: Negligible, instant
```

### Scenario 2: Launch Day Hype (50 graduations)

```
Bot checks every 10s
Finds 50 graduations
Processes in 5 batches (10 each)
Total time: ~2.5 minutes

Impact: All pools created within 3 minutes
```

### Scenario 3: Viral Event (1000 graduations)

```
Bot checks every 10s
Finds 1000 graduations
Processes in 100 batches (10 each)
Total time: ~50-90 minutes

Impact: All pools created within 1.5 hours
Users might wait 10-80 minutes for their pool
```

### Scenario 4: Mega Viral (10,000 graduations) 😱

```
Bot checks every 10s
Finds 10,000 graduations
Processes in 1000 batches (10 each)
Total time: ~8-15 hours

Impact: Long queue, might need to scale up
Consider multiple bot instances or larger batches
```

## 🚨 Failure Recovery

### Bot Crashes Mid-Processing

**State Persistence:**

Current implementation uses in-memory Set:
```javascript
let processedGraduations = new Set();
// Lost on restart! ❌
```

**Enhancement: Persist to file:**

```javascript
// Save processed graduations to disk
fs.writeFileSync('processed.json', 
  JSON.stringify(Array.from(processedGraduations))
);

// Load on startup
const saved = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync('processed.json'));
processedGraduations = new Set(saved);
```

**Or query blockchain to skip already seeded curves:**

```javascript
// Before processing, check if lp_seeded
const curve = await getCurveState(curveId);
if (curve.lp_seeded) {
  logger.info('Already processed, skipping');
  return;
}
```

**This prevents double-processing after restart!** ✅

## 🎯 Recommendations

### For Testnet (Low Traffic)

```bash
MAX_CONCURRENT_POOLS=10  # Default
POLLING_INTERVAL_MS=10000  # 10 seconds

# Handles: 1-100 graduations easily
# Max capacity: ~500/hour
```

### For Mainnet Launch (High Traffic Expected)

```bash
MAX_CONCURRENT_POOLS=20  # More aggressive
POLLING_INTERVAL_MS=5000  # 5 seconds (faster detection)

# Handles: 100-1000 graduations/hour
# Max capacity: ~2,400/hour
```

### For Viral Event (Mega Traffic)

```bash
# Option A: Increase batch size
MAX_CONCURRENT_POOLS=50

# Option B: Multiple bot instances
# Run 3-5 bots in parallel
# Coordinate via Redis queue
```
