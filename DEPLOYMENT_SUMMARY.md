# 🎉 Deployment Complete - Fixed Bonding Curve

## ✅ What Was Done

### 1. **Identified the Bug**
The bonding curve had a critical decimal conversion issue:
- **Buy**: Minted tokens WITHOUT multiplying by 1e9 (9 decimals)
- **Sell**: Compared smallest units to whole units incorrectly
- **Result**: Buy 50 SUI → get 0.02 tokens, sell 0.02 tokens → get 50 SUI back (exploit!)

### 2. **Fixed the Code**
- ✅ Buy function now multiplies by 1e9 when minting
- ✅ Sell function now divides by 1e9 when calculating supply
- ✅ TypeScript updated to pass amounts in correct units
- ✅ Fixed compilation errors in ticker_registry

### 3. **Deployed Fresh Package**
Since the old package had upgrade policy 0 (most restrictive), we deployed a completely new package with all fixes.

## 📦 New Production Addresses

```typescript
PLATFORM_PACKAGE: '0xc6a2e71b87b181251bcc44662616afad81288f78c330a6172792c1ec2c59761f'
PLATFORM_STATE: '0xb3a58b36c5805e38685ff9d9fa2197a015f13528075486085f1fd1e16d8daee4'
TICKER_REGISTRY: '0x3678022234b54f9ab84436efa95cc707236e4e999bd005c53775bd71c2e51f33'
```

**Transaction**: https://suiscan.xyz/testnet/tx/J2g68eLeM5dakPFFXzSvvw8LYbZUP2YBuhH3d9Meari1

## 🔧 Files Updated

1. **`suilfg_launch/sources/bonding_curve.move`**
   - Buy: Line 217 - Added `* 1_000_000_000` when minting
   - Sell: Line 244 - Added `/ 1_000_000_000` when calculating supply

2. **`suilfg_launch/sources/ticker_registry.move`**
   - Fixed field names (creation_ts_ms → last_use_ts_ms)

3. **`lib/constants.ts`**
   - Updated all contract addresses to new deployment

4. **`lib/sui/transactions.ts`**
   - Removed referral_registry references (not in v0.0.2 yet)
   - Updated buy() and sell() function arguments

## 🧪 Testing Instructions

### Quick Test
```bash
# 1. Create a test coin (use the compilation service)

# 2. Buy tokens with 50 SUI
# Expected: Get ~20-30 million tokens (not 0.02!)

# 3. Sell those tokens back
# Expected: Get ~50 SUI back (minus fees)
```

### Detailed Test Script
```typescript
import { SuiClient, getFullnodeUrl } from '@mysten/sui/client';
import { Ed25519Keypair } from '@mysten/sui/keypairs/ed25519';

const client = new SuiClient({ url: getFullnodeUrl('testnet') });
const keypair = Ed25519Keypair.deriveKeypair('your mnemonic here');

// 1. Create coin via compilation service
// 2. Buy with 50 SUI worth
// 3. Check balance - should be millions, not decimals
// 4. Sell half back
// 5. Verify you get appropriate SUI back
```

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Referral System
The new deployment **does not include the referral system yet**. This will be added in a future upgrade.

### Old Package
The old package at `0x39d07cf6ad6896e3dafc19293165eb96d05b385f21fac4bb3d794e50408c6047`:
- ❌ Still has the decimal bug
- ❌ Should not be used for new deployments
- ⚠️ Any existing bonding curves on it still have the bug

### Upgrade Policy
The new package has **policy 0** (default - most restrictive):
- ✅ Can add new functions
- ❌ Cannot modify existing functions
- 💡 If you need more flexibility later, you can:
  1. Add new function versions (e.g., `buy_v2()`)
  2. Or change the upgrade policy via a transaction

To make it more upgradeable later, use the UpgradeCap at:
`0x4f89ee52bc1a6c2b604d2f9a2235730828166837b828c8b4123db1bc07920a09`

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Test Thoroughly**
   - Create a test coin
   - Test buy/sell with various amounts
   - Verify token balances are correct

2. **Update Indexer** (if you have one)
   - Update package ID in indexer config
   - Restart indexer to track new curves

3. **Update Documentation**
   - Point users to new package
   - Update any API docs with new addresses

4. **Consider Adding Back**:
   - Referral system (as a new upgrade)
   - Cetus pool integration (with correct dependencies)
