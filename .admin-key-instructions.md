# üîê Admin Key Setup Instructions

To execute the LP bot address configuration, you need to provide the admin private key.

## Steps:

### 1. Export your admin private key as an environment variable:

```bash
export ADMIN_PRIVATE_KEY="suiprivkey..."
```

The admin private key is the one that owns the AdminCap:
- **AdminCap Object ID:** `0x7687bb4d6149db3c87ec3b96bbe3d4b59dbd9ed7f0a6de6a447422559332ca11`
- **Expected Owner:** `0x488e0c6d14c2334da9d72a309e7b63b37fdf93f2faa910e203aa7f73260df25f`

### 2. Run the script:

```bash
npx tsx set-lp-bot-address.ts
```

### 3. Verify the update:

The script will automatically verify that the LP bot address was set correctly.

## Security Notes:

- ‚ö†Ô∏è  **Never commit your private key to git**
- ‚úÖ Use environment variables for private keys
- ‚úÖ This key is stored in your local Sui keystore at `~/.sui/sui_config/sui.keystore`
- ‚úÖ For mainnet, we'll use a different wallet as you specified

---

## Alternative: Run from your local machine

If you prefer, you can also run this from your local machine where you have the Sui CLI set up:

1. Pull the latest code: `git pull origin main`
2. Make sure you're on the correct Sui address that owns the AdminCap
3. Run: `npx tsx set-lp-bot-address.ts`

The script will automatically use your active Sui CLI wallet.
