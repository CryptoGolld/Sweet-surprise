**Platform:** v0.0.5 (Fixed)

## ❓ User Questions

### Q1: "Try to buy with 100 SUILFG more, let's see what happens"

**Result:** ✅ **Transaction correctly REJECTED!**

**Transaction:** `Cy2L3UbkCj14irjsdZdpvZjTag1icKNdfUKMzqdgQZQ6`

**Error Code:** `MoveAbort 6 = E_SUPPLY_EXCEEDED`

**What this means:**
- ✅ Curve is at MAX_CURVE_SUPPLY (737M)
- ✅ Contract correctly rejects new buys
- ✅ Cannot oversell beyond 737M cap
- ✅ Fix is working perfectly!

---

### Q2: "Why did it not mark as graduated?"

**Answer:** 🎯 **Graduation is NOT automatic!**

**Graduation Process:**
1. ✅ Reach MAX_CURVE_SUPPLY (737M tokens sold)
2. ⏳ **Manually call** `try_graduate()`
3. ⏳ **Manually call** `distribute_payouts()`
4. ⏳ **Manually call** `seed_pool_and_create_cetus_with_lock()`

**Why manual?**
- Gives deployer control over timing
- Can coordinate LP creation with market conditions
- Separates concerns (selling vs. LP creation)

- Separates trading from LP creation
- Allows strategic timing

## 📝 For Frontend Developers

### Detecting When to Graduate
```typescript
const curve = await client.getObject({ id: curveId });
const supply = curve.data.content.fields.token_supply;

if (supply >= 737_000_000 && !curve.data.content.fields.graduated) {
  // Show "Graduate Now!" button
  // Call: bonding_curve::try_graduate()
}
```

### After Graduation
```typescript
if (curve.data.content.fields.graduated) {
  // Show:
  // 1. "Distribute Payouts" button
  // 2. "Create LP Pool" button
  // These are separate calls for safety
}
```
