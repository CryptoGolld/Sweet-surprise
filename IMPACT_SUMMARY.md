## 🔧 What NEEDS Updates (Only 3 things)

### 1. Contract Deployment
```bash
cd /workspace/contracts
npx tsx upgrade-v0.0.9.ts
```
**Result:** New PLATFORM_PACKAGE ID

### 2. Update Environment Variables

**Update in:**
- ✅ `lib/constants.ts` - Frontend package ID
- ✅ `pool-creation-bot/.env` - Bot package ID + REMOVE ADMIN_CAP line
- ✅ `indexer/.env` (if used) - Indexer package ID

**Example:**
```bash
# Old
PLATFORM_PACKAGE=0xa49978cdb7a2a6eacc974c830da8459089bc446248daed05e0fe6ef31e2f4348
ADMIN_CAP=0x7687bb4d6149db3c87ec3b96bbe3d4b59dbd9ed7f0a6de6a447422559332ca11

# New
PLATFORM_PACKAGE=0x...new_package_id_from_upgrade...
# (ADMIN_CAP line removed)
```

### 3. Restart Services
```bash
pm2 restart pool-creation-bot
# Frontend redeploys automatically via Vercel (if using)
```

## 🔐 Security Improvements

### Before (v0.0.8):
❌ Bot wallet had to OWN AdminCap  
❌ If bot wallet compromised = AdminCap compromised  
❌ Higher security risk

### After (v0.0.9):
✅ Bot wallet DOESN'T need AdminCap  
✅ AdminCap stays with admin wallet  
✅ Authorization via `lp_bot_address` only  
✅ Cleaner security model

## 🚨 Potential Issues & Fixes

### Issue 1: Bot fails with "E_UNAUTHORIZED_BOT"

**Cause:** Bot address not configured in platform_config

**Fix:**
```bash
# Re-run set-lp-bot-address.ts
cd /var/www/Sweet-surprise
npx tsx set-lp-bot-address.ts
```

### Issue 2: Frontend shows old coins but not new ones

**Cause:** PLATFORM_PACKAGE not updated in constants

**Fix:**
```bash
# Update lib/constants.ts
nano lib/constants.ts
# Change PLATFORM_PACKAGE to new ID
# Rebuild and redeploy
```

### Issue 3: Admin panel doesn't work

**Cause:** This shouldn't happen - admin functions unchanged

**Check:**
- Is your wallet connected?
- Do you own the AdminCap?
- Did PLATFORM_PACKAGE change in constants?
