## Testnet Faucet Issue ⚠️

The automated testnet faucet is currently experiencing issues:
- v1 endpoint is deprecated
- v2 endpoint format is unclear/changing
- Rate limiting is active

### Manual Faucet Options:
1. **Discord Faucet**: Join Sui Discord and use `!faucet <address>` command
   - Discord: https://discord.gg/sui
   
2. **Web Faucet** (if available):
   - https://testnet.sui.io/

3. **Sui CLI** (once faucet is fixed):
   ```bash
   sui client faucet --address 0xf8126f74277bcb2242aadd8f0a4780d6330f9a9fda403674de99b43223c0fbcb
   ```

## Alternative: Local Network Testing ✅

Started local Sui network for comprehensive testing:
- **Status**: Running (PID: 5513)
- **Purpose**: Test all functionality before testnet deployment

## Next Steps:

1. ✅ Complete comprehensive testing on local network
2. ⏳ Acquire testnet SUI tokens manually (Discord/Web faucet)
3. ⏳ Deploy to testnet once tokens received
4. ⏳ Re-run tests on testnet
5. ⏳ Document testnet contract addresses

---

**Note**: All functionality will be tested locally first, then replicated on testnet once tokens are available.
