## Q1: "Try to buy with 100 SUILFG more, let's see what happens"

### Answer: ‚úÖ **CONTRACT CORRECTLY REJECTED IT!**

**What we did:**
1. Curve already had 737,000,000 tokens (at max cap)
2. Tried to buy with 100 SUILFG
3. Transaction failed with **E_SUPPLY_EXCEEDED** (error code 6)

**Result:**
```
‚ùå Transaction: Cy2L3UbkCj14irjsdZdpvZjTag1icKNdfUKMzqdgQZQ6
‚ùå Status: FAILED (as expected!)
‚ùå Error: MoveAbort 6 = E_SUPPLY_EXCEEDED
```

**What this proves:**
- ‚úÖ Curve stops at EXACTLY 737M tokens
- ‚úÖ Cannot oversell even by 1 token
- ‚úÖ Fix is working perfectly!
- ‚úÖ Protection is SOLID!

## Q2: "Why did it not mark as graduated?"

### Answer: üéØ **GRADUATION IS NOT AUTOMATIC!**

**It's by design!** Here's why:

### Graduation is a 4-step MANUAL process:

```
Step 1: ‚úÖ Sell 737M tokens (DONE - automatic)
        ‚Üì
Step 2: ‚è≥ Call try_graduate() (MANUAL - deployer decides)
        ‚Üì
Step 3: ‚è≥ Call distribute_payouts() (MANUAL - distribute team tokens)
        ‚Üì
Step 4: ‚è≥ Call seed_pool_and_create_cetus_with_lock() (MANUAL - create DEX LP)
```

### Why manual?
1. **Control**: Deployer chooses WHEN to graduate
2. **Timing**: Can wait for best market conditions
3. **Safety**: Each step is separate and verified
4. **Coordination**: Can prepare LP creation strategy

1. ‚úÖ Bought to 737M cap (13,333 SUILFG)

3. ‚úÖ Triggered graduation (now graduated = true)

### What we learned:
