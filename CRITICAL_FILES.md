# ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL FILES - DO NOT DELETE

These files are **ESSENTIAL** for production operations. Deleting them will break the platform.

---

## üî¥ Configuration Files (NEVER DELETE)

### **ecosystem.config.cjs**
- **Purpose**: PM2 configuration for all production services
- **What it does**: Defines how to start/restart all bots and services
- **Used by**: `pm2 start ecosystem.config.cjs`
- **If deleted**: You'll lose the master config for all services

### **PM2_SERVICES.md**
- **Purpose**: Documentation of all production services
- **What it does**: Explains what each service does and how to manage them
- **Used by**: Reference when managing production server
- **If deleted**: You'll lose knowledge of what services are needed

## üü° Service Directories (NEVER DELETE)

### **/indexer/**
- **Contains**: `memecoin-indexer` and `memecoin-api`
- **Critical files**: `index.js`, `api-server.js`, `.env`
- **If deleted**: Token pages won't load, no blockchain indexing

### **/pool-creation-bot/**
- **Contains**: Pool creation automation
- **Critical files**: `index.js`, `.env`, `graduation-state.json`
- **If deleted**: Graduated tokens won't get Cetus pools

### **/compilation-service/**
- **Contains**: Move contract compiler
- **Critical files**: `index.js`, `.env`
- **If deleted**: Users can't create new tokens

## üü¢ Auto-Generated (Safe to Delete if Needed)

These files are regenerated automatically:

### **pool-creation-bot/graduation-state.json**
- **Purpose**: Tracks pool creation progress
- **Regenerates**: Automatically when bot processes graduations
- **Can delete if**: Bot needs fresh start (rare)

### **node_modules/**
- **Purpose**: NPM dependencies
- **Regenerates**: `npm install`
- **Can delete if**: Freeing disk space (then reinstall)

### **logs/** directories
- **Purpose**: Service logs
- **Regenerates**: Automatically as services run
- **Can delete if**: Freeing disk space

## üîµ Documentation (Safe but Useful)

### **BOT_AUTO_RECOVERY.md**
- Explains how pool bot recovers from crashes
- Safe to delete but useful for understanding system

### **FIX_GRADUATION_BALANCE.md**
- Deployment guide for contract fixes
- Historical reference, can delete if needed

### Other *.md files
- Most are historical documentation
- Can clean up old guides once verified they're obsolete

## üìã Quick Reference

### Files You Should NEVER Delete:
```
ecosystem.config.cjs          ‚Üê PM2 config
PM2_SERVICES.md              ‚Üê Service docs
indexer/                     ‚Üê Entire directory
pool-creation-bot/           ‚Üê Entire directory
compilation-service/         ‚Üê Entire directory
.env files                   ‚Üê ALL OF THEM
```

### Files Safe to Clean Up:
```
node_modules/                ‚Üê Reinstall with npm install
logs/                        ‚Üê Regenerates automatically
*.log files                  ‚Üê Can delete old logs
graduation-state.json        ‚Üê Only if bot needs reset
Old *.md docs                ‚Üê After verifying obsolete
```

## üóëÔ∏è Safe Cleanup Process

When freeing space:

1. **Delete old markdown docs** (after reading them first)
   ```bash
   # Example old docs that might be obsolete:
   rm CETUS_FIXED.md
   rm DEPLOYMENT_V0.0.8.md
   rm UBUNTU_FIX_COMMANDS.md
   # etc...
   ```

2. **Clean node_modules** (can reinstall)
   ```bash
   rm -rf node_modules
   npm install
   ```

3. **Clean old logs** (keep recent ones)
   ```bash
   find . -name "*.log" -mtime +30 -delete
   ```

4. **Clean build artifacts**
   ```bash
   rm -rf .next/
   rm -rf build/
   ```

## ‚úÖ Before Deleting Anything

Ask yourself:
1. Is it in the "NEVER DELETE" list above? ‚Üí **Don't delete**
2. Is it a `.env` file? ‚Üí **Don't delete**
3. Is it in `/indexer`, `/pool-creation-bot`, or `/compilation-service`? ‚Üí **Don't delete**
4. Is it `ecosystem.config.cjs` or `PM2_SERVICES.md`? ‚Üí **Don't delete**
5. Is it a markdown file you've never read? ‚Üí **Read it first, then maybe delete**
6. Is it `node_modules` or `logs`? ‚Üí **Safe to delete** (can regenerate)

---

**When in doubt, DON'T DELETE IT!**

Ask someone or check `PM2_SERVICES.md` first.
