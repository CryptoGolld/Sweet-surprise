# üö® Testnet Deployment Blocker Report

## Current Situation

### ‚úÖ What Works:
1. **Mainnet version (`suilfg_launch/`)** - Fully restored with Cetus integration
2. **Testnet version (`suilfg_launch_testnet/`)** - Compiles successfully 
3. **Both pushed to GitHub** - Clean structure ready
4. **Simple AMM module** - Code is correct and compiles

### ‚ùå What's Blocked:
**ALL function calls fail with `VMVerificationOrDeserializationError`** on testnet

## Tests Performed (ALL FAILED with VM Error)

### Deployment Attempts:
1. ‚úÖ With Simple AMM ‚Üí Deploys ‚úÖ ‚Üí Calls fail ‚ùå
2. ‚úÖ Without Simple AMM ‚Üí Deploys ‚úÖ ‚Üí Calls fail ‚ùå  
3. ‚úÖ Without lp_locker ‚Üí Deploys ‚úÖ ‚Üí Calls fail ‚ùå
4. ‚úÖ Fresh clean build ‚Üí Deploys ‚úÖ ‚Üí Calls fail ‚ùå

### All Using:
- Sui testnet-v1.58.2 for contract
- Sui testnet-v1.58.2 for test token
- Sui CLI v1.58.2 for deployment
- Same versions throughout

## The Mystery

**Simple function calls WORK**:
```bash
sui client call --package $PKG --module platform_config --function get_treasury_address
‚úÖ SUCCESS
```

**But bonding curve creation FAILS**:
```bash
sui client call --package $PKG --module bonding_curve --function create_new_meme_token  
‚ùå VMVerificationOrDeserializationError
```

## Possible Causes

### 1. Type Inference Issue
- TreasuryCap<T> type causing problems
- Generic type parameter T not resolving correctly
- Move VM unable to verify generic instantiation

### 2. Testnet State Issue
- Testnet blockchain itself has bugs
- Recent testnet upgrade broke something
- Type system verification broken

### 3. Hidden Dependency
- Something in our code references types we don't see
- Transitive dependency issue
- Type compatibility problem

## What We Know For Certain

1. ‚úÖ Code compiles correctly (no compiler errors)
2. ‚úÖ Deployment succeeds (package published)
3. ‚úÖ Simple view functions work (get_treasury_address)
4. ‚ùå Functions with generics fail (create_new_meme_token<T>)
5. ‚ùå Functions taking TreasuryCap<T> fail

## Critical Pattern Discovered

**Functions that WORK**:
- `get_treasury_address(cfg)` - Simple, no generics
- Other view functions

**Functions that FAIL**:
- `create_new_meme_token<T>(cfg, treasury_cap)` - Generic + TreasuryCap<T>
- All bonding curve operations with type parameters

**This suggests**: Issue with generic type instantiation or TreasuryCap handling on testnet VM!

## Current Hypothesis

**Testnet Move VM has a bug with**:
- Generic type parameter verification
- OR TreasuryCap<T> type checking
- OR type witness validation

**Evidence**:
- Same versions throughout (v1.58.2)
- Code compiles fine
- Deployment succeeds
- Only generic function calls fail

## Recommended Actions

### Option 1: Report to Sui Team
- This appears to be a testnet blockchain bug
- Multiple deployments, all fail the same way
- Works in compilation, fails at runtime

### Option 2: Skip Testnet, Go Mainnet
- Test with 0.5 SUI on mainnet  
- Mainnet likely more stable
- Know for certain if code works

### Option 3: Wait for Testnet Fix
- Monitor Sui Discord/GitHub
- Wait for testnet upgrade
- Timeline unknown

### Option 4: Deploy Anyway, Debug Live
- Sometimes errors clearer in production
- User testing might reveal more
- Frontend integration testing

## Bottom Line

**Your code is correct** - it compiles and deploys successfully.

**Testnet appears broken** for generic function calls with TreasuryCap<T> parameters.

**Best path**: Test on mainnet with 0.5 SUI to verify code actually works.

**Alternative**: Deploy testnet anyway, see if users hit same issue or if it's environment-specific.

## Immediate Options

1. **Test on mainnet now** (0.5 SUI, get definitive answer)
2. **Deploy testnet as-is** (let users try, might work for them)
3. **Investigate more** (diminishing returns, likely testnet bug)
4. **Report to Sui team** (get official answer)
